= INSTALL - lipsync

To get started with lipsync you need at least a client and a server, perferably on multiple systems

== Server install

===Install required software

==== Debian (squeeze) / Ubuntu (maverick)
	apt-get install openssh-server rsync unison

Create a user to sync with, should be the same name as the one on the client 
	useradd -U -m -d /home/USER -p PASSWORD -s /bin/bash USER

Verfiy the account was created, and setup a sync directory to sync with
	su - USER
	mkdir ~/sync

== Client install

=== Install required software

==== Debian (squeeze) / Ubuntu (maverick)
	apt-get install openssh-client rsync unison lsyncd

Please make sure that lsyncd installed is version 1.x and not version 2.x as it uses different config files.

Create a user to sync with, should be the same as the one on the server
        useradd -U -m -d /home/USER -p PASSWORD -s /bin/bash USER

Verfiy the account was created, and setup a sync directory to sync with
	su - USER
	mkdir ~/sync

Install lipsync (if installing from git, first apt-get git-core)
	git clone git://github.com/philcryer/lipsync.git
	cd lipsync
	chmod +x setup.sh

NOTE: during setup, define server IP, path to sync, username and password, so have those ready

Then run the setup script
	sudo ./setup.sh

After you've answered the questions, watch the script's output for errors. Then, check the logs to see if lipsyncd started successfully 
	tail -f /var/log/lipsyncd.log

= Test

== Open 3 terminals

=== Terminal 1 - on the client, become root and watch the logfile
	su - root
	tail -f /var/log/lipsyncd.log

=== Terminal 2 - on the client, become your normal user
	su - USER

=== Terminal 3 -  on the server, run a watch on the sync directory
	watch ls -l /home/USER/sync
NOTE: this terminal will refresh every 2s by default

=== Terminal 2 - on the client, create a new file in the sync directory
	touch sync/testfile

At this point you should see action on the logfile (Terminal 1), and after a few seconds delay, the file should appear in the server's sync directory (Terminal 2). If this worked, then delete the file on the client (Terminal 2) and see if that change propogates to the server (Terminal 3). 

Now try more complex situations by using directories that are full of other files, then file or directory names with spaces in them, then ones with special characters (!@#$%^&*_-) in them. These should all work the same as the initial examples, always propogating to the server after a slight delay (the delay occurs so lsyncd can prevent spinning up for every little change - if there are other changes after the first one they will be chained to the one sync, making things more efficient)

= Install more clients
Now that you have a working 2 node setup, it's time to install on more clients. All you need to do is follow the same client install directions on each client you add. Be sure to use the same server IP or domainname, this way Unison will work in a star style setup, with the server being the hub, and the clients all serving as spokes. This way the hub 'wins' if it has something the spokes need, but will sync-up by deleting any missing files from the spoke in the hub. It sounds more complicated than it is, but suffice to say, it works.
